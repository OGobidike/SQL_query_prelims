# Chinook SQL Project
Welcome to my Chinook Music Store SQL Analysis project! In this project, I stepped into the role of a data analyst for a fictional online music store, Chinook, to uncover key business insights. Using advanced SQL queries and Python for data visualization, I explored customer trends, sales patterns, and top-performing albums, artists, and tracks.

This project showcases my proficiency in SQL and Python—essential tools for data analysis—and demonstrates how I use them to derive actionable insights from relational databases.
